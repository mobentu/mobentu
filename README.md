## hi ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸŒ± Hello, I am a programmer like you and this is considered fun for me
- ðŸŒ± Honestly, I've struggled with many languages â€‹â€‹and spent a lot of time learning each one, so I can't say which one I really know because I know a little bit of almost all of them.
- ðŸ”­ **html/css/sccs/javascript/typescript/katlin/python/go/php/c/c++/powershell/bash**
- âš¡ At the moment, I am in love with **Go** and I think I will continue with this, of course, maybe
- âš¡ In the end, I suggest you, my good friend, don't get confused in the programming world, choose any branch you like and consider one language as your main language and don't jump from one branch to another
- ðŸ˜‰ The best programmers in the world also started with the "Hello World!" program
